# React-Redux Form Application

## Application Description

This application is a simple yet powerful example of form management built using React and Redux. It allows users to input their first name, last name, email, and a message into a form. This project aims to demonstrate best practices for state management, form validation, and testing. The form includes field validations implemented using the `validator` library. It disables the submit button when any field is invalid and enables it when all validations pass.

As an engineer, you'll find this example very useful to understand how to structure your Redux store, how to set up Redux slices for form data, and how to integrate third-party libraries for validation. Additionally, the application is equipped with Jest and React Testing Library to run unit tests, making it robust and maintainable in the long term.
